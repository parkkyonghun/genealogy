# Khmer Genealogy Style Guide

This document outlines the design specification for a Khmer-inspired theme for the genealogy project's home page.

## 1. Color Palette

A color palette inspired by traditional Khmer art, temples, and natural landscapes.

- **Primary:** `#A50021` (Rich Temple Red) - A deep, warm red reminiscent of the lacquer and stone carvings found in ancient Khmer temples.
- **Secondary:** `#F2E8C9` (Sandstone) - A light, earthy tone that evokes the sandstone blocks of Angkor Wat and provides a neutral background.
- **Accent:** `#FFC107` (Golden Apsara) - A vibrant gold, symbolizing royalty and the intricate ornamentation of Apsara dancers.

## 2. Typography

Fonts that are readable and evoke a sense of Khmer heritage.

- **Headings:** [Koulen](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Koulen) - A strong, condensed display font that is excellent for headlines. It has a modern feel while retaining a hint of traditional Khmer character.
- **Body Text:** [Hanuman](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Hanuman) - A highly readable serif font that is optimized for screen use. It pairs well with Koulen and is suitable for longer passages of text.

## 3. Iconography and Imagery

Visual elements that reflect Khmer culture and the theme of genealogy.

- **Icons:** Use icons that are inspired by traditional Khmer patterns (kbach). These could include simplified versions of lotus flowers, mythical creatures like the Naga or Garuda, and other geometric patterns found in temple carvings.
- **Imagery:** Feature high-quality photographs of Angkor Wat, Bayon, and other Khmer temples. Images of lush rice paddies, traditional ceremonies, and Apsara dancers would also be appropriate. Imagery should be rich in texture and detail.

## 4. Layout and Components

A proposed layout for the home page, including styling for existing components and ideas for new ones.

- **Layout:** A two-column layout. The main column will feature the Markdown content, while a sidebar can display a "family tree of the day" or other featured content. The header should be prominent, with the site title in the Koulen font.
- **Components:**
    - **Buttons:** Buttons should have a subtle gradient using the primary and accent colors. On hover, they could display a faint Khmer pattern.
    - **Cards:** Cards used for featured content should have a border inspired by Khmer ornamentation and use the sandstone color for the background.
    - **Navigation:** The main navigation should be simple and clean, using the Hanuman font. The active link can be highlighted with the golden accent color.
